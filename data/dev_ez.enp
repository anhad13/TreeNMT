( It ( ( ( was n't ) ( all bad ) ) . ) )

( ( Some ( of us ) ) ( ( were ( ( ( eating ( in ( good restaurants ) ) ) and ) ( learning ( how ( to ( cook well ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )

( ( The first ) ( ( is ( -- ( death ( is ( a ( big problem ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( If ( you ( look ( at ( the statistics ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( the odds ) ( ( ( ( are not ) ( very favorable ) ) ( to us ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( So far ) ( , ( ( ( most people ) ( who ( have lived ) ) ) ( , ( ( ( have also ) died ) . ) ) ) ) )
( ( ( ( Roughly 90 ) percent ) ( of ( everybody ( who ( has ( been alive ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( has ( died ( by now ) ) ) . ) )
( So ( ( the ( annual ( death rate ) ) ) ( ( ( ( adds up ) ( to ( ( ( ( 150,000 -- ) sorry ) , ) ( the ( daily ( death rate ) ) ) ) ) ) ( -- ( ( ( ( 150,000 people ) ( per day ) ) , ) ( which ( is ( ( a ( huge number ) ) ( by ( any standard ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( The ( annual ( death rate ) ) ) ( , ( then ( , ( ( becomes ( 56 million ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( ( If ( ( ( we ( just ( look ( at ( ( the ( single ( , ( biggest cause ) ) ) ) ( of death ) ) ) ) ) ) -- ) ( aging ( -- ( it ( accounts ( for ( ( roughly two-thirds ) ( of ( ( all ( human people ) ) ( who die ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( That ( ( ( ( adds up ) ( to ( ( an ( annual ( death toll ) ) ) ( of greater ) ) ) ) ( than ( ( the population ) ( of Canada ) ) ) ) . ) )
( Sometimes ( , ( we ( ( ( do n't ) ( ( see ( a problem ) ) ( because ( either ( ( ( ( it ( 's ( too familiar ) ) ) , ) or ) ( it ( 's ( too big ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( Ca ( n't ( ( ( see it ) ( because ( it ( 's ( too big ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( I ( ( think ( death ( might ( ( be ( both ( ( ( too familiar ) and ) ( too big ) ) ) ) ( for ( ( most people ) ( to ( ( see it ) ( as ( a problem ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( Once ( you ( think ( about it ) ) ) ) ( , ( you ( ( see ( this ( ( is not ) ( statistical points ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( I ( ( 've ( talked ( for ( three minutes ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( So ( that ( would ( ( be , ) ( roughly ( , ( ( 324 people ) ( have ( died ( since ( I ( 've ( begun speaking ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( ( ( People like ) -- ) ( it ( 's ( roughly ( ( ( the population ) ( in ( this room ) ) ) ( ( has just ) died ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( Now ( , ( ( ( the ( human cost ) ) ( of that ) ) ( ( is obvious ) . ) ) ) )
( Once ( you ( ( start ( to ( think ( about ( ( it -- ) ( ( ( ( ( the suffering ) , ) ( the loss ) ) -- ) ( it ( ( ( ( ( 's also ) , ) economically ) , ) ( enormously wasteful ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( I ( just ( ( ( ( ( look ( at ( the information ) ) ) , ) and ) ( ( ( ( ( ( ( knowledge , ) and ) ( experience ( that ( is ( lost ( due ( to ( ( ( natural causes ) ( of death ) ) ( in general ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) and ) aging ) ( , ( in particular ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( Now ( , ( ( of course ) ( , ( this ( ( is ( an under-estimation ) ) . ) ) ) ) ) )
( ( ( ( A ( person 's ) ) lifetime ) ( of ( ( learning and ) experience ) ) ) ( ( is ( ( ( a lot ) more ) ( than ( you ( could ( put ( into ( a ( single book ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )

( ( Library ( of Congress ) ) ( ( holds ( ( 18 million ) volumes ) ) . ) )
( We ( ( are ( upset ( about ( ( the burning ) ( of ( ( the Library ) ( of Alexandria ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( It ( ( ( ( ( 's ( one ( of ( ( the ( great ( cultural tragedies ) ) ) ( that ( we remember ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) even ) today ) . ) )
( But ( this ( ( is ( ( ( the equivalent ) ( of ( ( three Libraries ) ( of Congress ) ) ) ) ( -- ( ( ( ( ( burnt down ) , ) ( forever lost ) ) -- ) ( each year ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( So ( that ( ( 's ( the ( first ( big problem ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( I ( ( ( ( ( ( wish Godspeed ) ( to ( Aubrey ( de Grey ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( ( ( ( other people ) ( like him ) ) , ) ( to ( try ( to ( ( ( do something ) ( about this ) ) ( ( as soon ) ( as possible ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( ( ( Existential risk ) -- ) ( the ( second ( big problem ) ) ) ) . )
( ( Existential risk ) ( ( is ( ( ( ( ( a threat ) ( to ( human survival ) ) ) , ) or ) ( to ( ( the ( long-term potential ) ) ( of ( our species ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( ( ( ( Well ( , ( let ( ( ( 's ( first look ) ) ( at ( the probability ) ) ) -- ) ) ) ) and ) ( this ( is ( very ( difficult ( to estimate ) ) ) ) ) ) -- ) but ) ( ( ( there ( have ( ( been ( ( ( only four ) studies ) ( on this ) ) ) ( in ( recent years ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( which ( is surprising ) ) ) ) . )
( ( ( ( ( You ( would ( think ( that ( it ( would ( ( be ( of ( some interest ) ) ) ( to ( try ( to ( ( find out ) ( ( more ( about this ) ) ( given ( that ( ( the stakes ) ( are ( so big ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) but ) ( it ( 's ( a ( ( very neglected ) area ) ) ) ) ) . )
( But ( there ( ( have ( ( been ( ( ( ( four studies ) -- ) ( one ( by ( John Lesley ) ) ) ) , ) ) ( wrote ( ( a book ) ( on this ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( ( ( ( ( Another author ) ( ( does n't ) ( give ( any ( numerical estimate ) ) ) ) ) , ) but ) ( says ( ( the probability ) ( is ( significant ( that ( it ( will fail ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( Now ( , ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( the ( exact figures ) ) here ) ( , ( we ( should ( take ( with ( ( a ( big grain ) ) ( of salt ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) but ) ( there seems ) ) ( to ( be ( ( a consensus ) ( that ( ( the risk ) ( is substantial ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( Everybody ( who ( has ( ( ( looked ( at this ) ) and ) ( studied it ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( agrees . ) ) )
( Now ( , ( ( if ( we ( think ( about ( ( what ( just ( ( reducing ( ( the probability ) ( of ( human extinction ) ) ) ) ( by ( ( ( ( just one ) ( percentage point ) ) -- ) ( not ( very much ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( -- ( ( so ( that ( 's ( equivalent ( to ( ( ( 60 million ) lives ) saved ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( if ( we ( just ( count ( ( ( the ( ( currently living ) people ) ) , ) ( the ( current generation ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( Now ( ( ( one percent ) ( of ( ( six billion ) people ) ) ) ( ( is ( equivalent ( to ( 60 million ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( So ( that ( ( 's ( a ( large number ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( If ( we ( were ( to ( take ( into ( ( account ( future generations ) ) ( that ( ( will never ) ( ( come ( into existence ) ) ( if ( we ( ( blow ourselves ) up ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( then ( ( the figure ) ( ( becomes astronomical ) . ) ) ) ) )
( ( ( ( Then ( , ( ( ( even ( a ( ( one ( percentage point ) ) reduction ) ) ) ( in ( the ( extinction risk ) ) ) ) ( could ( be ( equivalent ( to ( this ( astronomical number ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) -- ) ( 10 ( to ( ( the power ) ( of 32 ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( So ( ( if ( you ( ( take ( into ( account ( future generations ) ) ) ) ( ( as much ) ( as ( our own ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( ( every ( other ( moral imperative ) ) ) ( of ( philanthropic cost ) ) ) ( just ( becomes irrelevant ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( ( The ( only thing ) ) ( you ( should ( focus on ) ) ) ) ( ( would ( be ( to ( ( reduce ( existential risk ) ) ( because ( ( ( even ( the ( tiniest decrease ) ) ) ( in ( existential risk ) ) ) ( ( would just ) ( overwhelm ( ( any ( other benefit ) ) ( you ( could ( hope ( to achieve ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( ( ( even ( ( ( ( if ( you ( just ( look ( at ( the ( current people ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( ignore ( ( the potential ) ( that ( would ( ( be lost ) ( if ( we ( went extinct ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( it ( ( would still ) ( have ( a ( high priority ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( Now ( , ( ( let ( me ( ( ( ( spend ( ( the rest ) ( of ( my time ) ) ) ) ( on ( the ( third ( big problem ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( because ( it ( ( 's ( ( ( more subtle ) and ) ( perhaps difficult ) ) ) ( to grasp ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )

( But ( there ( ( 's ( ( ( a kind ) ( of queasiness ) ) ( that ( these ( ( are unnatural ) ( in ( some way ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( It ( ( 's ( worth ( recalling ( ( ( that ( there ( are ( ( a lot ) ( of ( other ( modification technologies ) ) ) ) ) ) ) and ) ( ( enhancement technologies ) ( that ( we use ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )

( ( ( ( ( ( ( Contraceptives , ) cosmetics ) and ) ( brain ( reprogramming techniques ) ) ) -- ) ( that ( sounds ominous ) ) ) . )

( ( ( ( ( It ( ( 's always ) ( the ( same ( three things ) ) ) ) ) , ) so ) ( let ( 's ( explore that ) ) ) ) . )
( ( Samuel ( Pierpont Langley ) ) ( ( was ( ( ( given ( 50,000 dollars ) ) ( by ( the ( War Deptartment ) ) ) ) ( to ( ( figure out ) ( this ( flying machine ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( Money ( ( was ( no problem ) ) . ) )
( He ( ( ( ( ( ( held ( ( a seat ) ( at Harvard ) ) ) and ) ( worked ( at ( the Smithsonian ) ) ) ) and ) ( was ( extremely well-connected ) ) ) . ) )
( He ( ( knew ( ( all ( the ( big minds ) ) ) ( of ( the day ) ) ) ) . ) )

( And ( everyone ( ( was ( rooting ( for Langley ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( ( ( A ( few ( hundred miles ) ) ) away ) ( in ( ( ( ( ( Dayton Ohio ) , ) Orville ) and ) ( Wilbur Wright ) ) ) ) ( , ( they ( ( had ( none ( of ( what ( we ( consider ( to ( be ( ( the recipe ) ( for success ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( They ( ( had ( no money ) ) . ) )
( They ( ( paid ( for ( ( their dream ) ( with ( ( the proceeds ) ( from ( their ( bicycle shop ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( Not ( a ( single person ) ) ) ( on ( ( the ( Wright ( brothers ' ) ) ) team ) ) ) ( ( had ( ( ( a ( college education ) ) , ) ( not ( even ( ( Orville or ) Wilbur ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( ( the ( New ( York Times ) ) ) ( ( ( followed them ) ( around nowhere ) ) . ) ) )
( ( The difference ) ( ( ( was , ) ( ( ( Orville and ) Wilbur ) ( ( ( ( ( were ( driven ( by ( a cause ) ) ) ) , ) ( by ( a purpose ) ) ) , ) ( by ( a belief ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( They ( ( believed ( that ( ( if ( they ( could ( ( figure out ) ( this ( flying machine ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( it ( 'll ( change ( ( the course ) ( of ( the world ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( ( He ( wanted ( to ( be rich ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( he ( wanted ( to ( be famous ) ) ) ) ) . )
( He ( ( was ( in ( pursuit ( of ( the riches ) ) ) ) ) . ) )

( ( ( The people ) ( who ( believed ( in ( ( the ( Wright ( brothers ' ) ) ) dream ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( ( worked ( with them ) ) ( with ( ( ( ( blood and ) sweat ) and ) tears ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( The others ) ( just ( ( worked ( for ( the paycheck ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( they ( ( tell ( stories ( of ( how ( ( ( every time ) ( ( the ( Wright brothers ) ) ( went out ) ) ) ( , ( they ( would ( ( ( have ( to ( take ( ( five sets ) ( of parts ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( because ( that ( 's ( how ( ( many times ) ( they ( would ( crash ( before ( they ( ( came in ) ( for supper ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( ( And ( , ( eventually , ) ) ) ( ( on ( ( December 17th ) ( , ( ( ( ( ( ( 1903 , ) ( ( the ( Wright brothers ) ) ( took flight ) ) ) , ) and ) ( no one ) ) ( ( was there ) ( ( to even ) ( experience it ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( We ( ( ( found ( out ( about it ) ) ) ( ( a ( few days ) ) later ) ) . ) )
( ( And ( ( further proof ) ( that ( Langley ( was ( motivated ( ( by ( the ( wrong thing ) ) ) ( , ( ( ( the day ) ( ( the ( Wright brothers ) ) ( took flight ) ) ) ( , ( he quit ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( He ( ( ( was n't ) first ) , ) ) ( he ( ( did n't ) ( get rich ) ) ) ) , ) ( he ( ( did n't ) ( get famous ) ) ) ) , ) so ) ( he quit ) ) . )
( ( ( ( People ( ( do n't ) ( buy ( what ( you do ) ) ) ) ) ; ) ( they ( buy ( why ( you ( do it ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( And ( ( ( if ( you ( talk ( about ( what ( you believe ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( you ( will ( attract ( those ( who ( believe ( what ( you believe ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( ( if ( you ( ( do n't ) ( know ( the law ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( you ( definitely ( ( know ( the terminology ) ) . ) ) ) ) ) )
( ( ( The ( only reason ) ) ( ( these people ) ( buy ( touch ( tone phones ) ) ) ) ) ( ( is ( because ( you ( ( ca n't ) ( ( buy ( rotary phones ) ) anymore ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( then ( ( the ( system tips ) ) . ) ) )
( That ( ( 's ( how ( we ( ( ( describe them ) , ) right ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( Because ( , ( ( you see ) , ) ) ) ( ( the ( early majority ) ) ( ( will not ) ( ( try something ) ( until ( ( someone else ) ( has ( ( tried it ) first ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )

( They ( ( ( 're ( more ( comfortable making ) ) ) ( ( those ( intuitive decisions ) ) ( that ( are ( ( ( driven ( by ( what ( they ( believe ( about ( the world ) ) ) ) ) ) ) and ) ( ( not just ) ( ( what product ) ( is available ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( These ( ( are ( ( the people ) ( who ( ( ( stood ( on line ) ) ( for ( six hours ) ) ) ( to ( ( buy ( an iPhone ) ) ( when ( they ( first ( ( ( came out ) , ) ( when ( you ( could ( have ( just ( ( ( ( walked ( into ( the store ) ) ) ( the ( next week ) ) ) and ) ( ( bought one ) ( off ( the shelf ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( These ( ( are ( ( the people ) ( ( ( 40,000 dollars ) ( on ( flat ( screen TVs ) ) ) ) ( when ( they ( first ( ( ( came out ) , ) ( even ( though ( ( the technology ) ( was substandard ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )

( ( ( ( People ( ( do n't ) ( buy ( what ( you do ) ) ) ) ) ; ) ( they ( buy ( what ( you ( do it ) ) ) ) ) ) . )

( ( In fact ) ( , ( people ( ( will ( do ( ( the things ) ( that ( prove ( what ( they believe ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( The reason ) ( ( that ( person ( ( bought ( the iPhone ) ) ( in ( the ( first ( six hours ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( stood ( in ( line ( for ( six hours ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( was ( because ( ( ( ( of ( what ( they ( believed ( about ( the world ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( how ( they ( wanted ( everybody ( to ( see them ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) ) )
( They ( ( were first ) . ) )
( ( ( ( People ( ( do n't ) ( buy ( what ( you do ) ) ) ) ) ; ) ( they ( buy ( why ( you ( do it ) ) ) ) ) ) . )

( First ( , ( ( the ( famous failure ) ) . ) ) )
( It ( ( 's ( a ( commercial example ) ) ) . ) )
( ( As ( we ( said before ) ) ) ( , ( ( ( a second ) ago ) ( , ( ( ( the recipe ) ( for success ) ) ( ( is ( ( ( ( money and ) ( the ( right people ) ) ) and ) ( the ( right ( market conditions ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) ) )
( ( Look ( at TiVo ) ) . )
( ( ( From ( ( the time ) ( TiVo ( came out ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( ( ( ( ( about eight ) or ) nine ) years ) ago ) ( , ( ( to ( this ( current day ) ) ) ( , ( they ( are ( ( the ( single ( highest-quality product ) ) ) ( on ( the market ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( , ( ( hands down ) ( , ( there ( ( is ( no dispute ) ) . ) ) ) ) ) )
( ( Market conditions ) ( ( were fantastic ) . ) )
( I ( mean ( , ( we ( ( ( use TiVo ) ( as verb ) ) . ) ) ) ) )
( I ( ( ( ( TiVo stuff ) ( on ( ( my piece ) ( of ( junk ( Time ( Warner DVR ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( all ( the time ) ) ) . ) )
( They ( ( ( 've never ) ( made money ) ) . ) )
( And ( ( when ( they ( went IPO ) ) ) ( , ( ( ( ( ( ( their stock ) ( ( ( ( was ( at ( ( ( ( about 30 ) or ) 40 ) dollars ) ) ) and ) then ) plummeted ) ) , ) and ) ( it ( ( 's never ) ( traded ( above 10 ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( In fact ) ( , ( I ( ( ( ( do n't ) even ) ( think ( it ( 's ( ( ( traded ( above six ) ) , ) ( except ( for ( ( a couple ) ( of ( little spikes ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( ( ( ( People ( ( do n't ) ( buy ( what ( you do ) ) ) ) ) ; ) ( they ( buy ( why ( you ( do it ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( And ( ( what ( you ( ( do simply ) ( serves ( as ( ( the proof ) ( of ( what ( you believe ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( Now ( let ( me ( ( give you ) ( ( a ( successful example ) ) ( of ( ( the law ) ( of ( diffusion ( of innovation ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( ( ( ( ( They ( ( sent out ) ( no invitations ) ) ) , ) and ) ( there ( was ( ( no website ) ( to ( check ( the date ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
( He ( ( ( was n't ) ( ( ( the ( only man ) ) ( in America ) ) ( who ( suffered ( in ( a ( pre-civil ( rights America ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( In fact ) ( , ( ( some ( of ( his ideas ) ) ) ( ( were bad ) . ) ) ) )
( But ( he ( ( had ( a gift ) ) . ) ) )
( He ( ( ( ( went around ) and ) ( told ( people ( what ( he believed ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( ( ( ( ( people ( who ( believed ( what ( he ( believed ( took ( his cause ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( ( ( ( they ( made ( it ( their own ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( they ( told people ) ) ) ) . ) )
( And ( ( some ( of ( those people ) ) ) ( ( ( created structures ) ( to ( ( get ( the word ) ) ( out ( to ( ( even more ) people ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) )
( And ( ( ( ( low and ) behold ) , ) ( ( 250,000 people ) ( ( ( ( ( ( ( showed up ) ( on ( the ( right day ) ) ) ) , ) ( at ( the ( right time ) ) ) ) , ) ( to ( hear ( him speak ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( They ( ( ( showed up ) ( for themselves ) ) . ) )
( It ( ( ( 's ( what ( they ( believed ( about America ) ) ) ) ) ( that ( got ( them ( to ( ( ( travel ( in ( ( a bus ) ( for ( eight hours ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( to ( stand ( in ( ( ( the sun ) ( in Washington ) ) ( in ( ( the middle ) ( of August ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( ( ( ( ( It ( 's ( what ( they believed ) ) ) ) , ) and ) ( it ( ( was n't ) ( about ( ( black versus ) white ) ) ) ) ) . )
( And ( ( not ( ( ( until ( ( ( all ( the laws ) ) ( that ( are ( made ( by man ) ) ) ) ) ( are ( consistent ( with ( ( the laws ) ( that ( are ( made ( by ( the ( higher authority ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ) ( ( will we ) ( live ( in ( a ( just world ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
( It ( just ( so ( ( happened ( that ( ( the ( Civil ( Rights Movement ) ) ) ( was ( ( the ( perfect thing ) ) ( to ( help ( him ( bring ( ( his cause ) ( to life ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) ) ) )
( We ( ( ( followed , ) ( not ( ( ( ( for him ) , ) but ) ( for ourselves ) ) ) ) . ) )

( ( Because ( ( ( there ( are leaders ) ) and ) ( there ( are ( those ( who lead ) ) ) ) ) ) . )
